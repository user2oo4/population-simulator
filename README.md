Simulation of population growth.

## Description
The goal is to simulate population growth and get data about expected distance between two people based on their background.
In order to achieve this, the simulation has to simulate different subsets of populations based on the population and life expectancy data, as well as immigration data and some major events (major population shift, pandemics, etc.) that caused a big change in population.
This is difficult to be done right away so I will try to go through different iterations.

## Iterations

### Iteration 1 (simple)
Given input of starting population, ending population, life expectancy, newborn death rate, simulate the growth of population and find a way to visualize the data.
Details can be viewed in the folder's notes.md file.
